Thank you for following UN Rights Chief Pillay's statement to the #UNSC - Read the full speech: http://t.co/w0tgGxi59b #ICYMI
This Council has the mandate to address crises before they escalate into threats to int'l peace &amp; security - Pillay to #UNSC
The laws of the UN are most needed when conflict looms - UN #HumanRights Chief Pillay to the UN #SecurityCouncil
Pillay to #UNSC: Sovereign states established @UN because they knew #Rights violations cause conflict &amp; undermine sovereignty
State sovereignty is often invoked to deflect UN action to prevent serious #HumanRights violations - UN Rights Pillay to #UNSC
Use of #veto to stop actions intended to prevent/defuse conflict is a short-term &amp; counter-productive tactic - Pillay to #UNSC
I firmly believe that greater responsiveness by this Council would have saved hundreds of thousands of lives - Pillay to #UNSC
There has not always been a firm and principled decision by Members to put an end to crises - UN #Rights Chief Pillay to #UNSC
The Security Council’s interest in #HumanRights has increased markedly during my tenure - @UNrightswire Chief Pillay to #UNSC
Although specifics could not necessarily be predicted, many #HumanRights violations at their core were known - Pillay to #UNSC
None of these crises erupted w/o warning. They built up over years, even decades, of #HumanRights grievances – Pillay to #UNSC
Other conflicts in Afghanistan, CAR, DRC, Iraq, Libya, Mali, OPT, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan &amp; Ukraine - Pillay to #UNSC
#SyriaConflict is metastasing outwards in an uncontrollable process whose eventual limits we cannot predict – Pillay to #UNSC
#HumanRights are always central to conflict prevention - @UNRightswire Pillay to UN #SecurityCouncil
In #SouthAfrica, @UN helped end 300 years of injustice when it declared apartheid a crime agst humanity - Pillay to #UNSC
Conflict prevention is complex but it can be achieved - UN #HumanRights Chief Pillay to the UN #SecurityCouncil

UNSG called for talks for #ceasefire &amp; negotiations on underlying issues, incl. #Gaza blockade &amp; 50 years of occupation –Pillay
Over the years, constant efforts to evade binding nature of int’l human rights &amp; humanitarian law in #Israel &amp; #OPT – Pillay
#ICC’s role is to end impunity &amp; render justice in cases where national authorities were unable or unwilling to do so – Pillay
2009 Fact-Finding Mission on #Gaza noted need for #ICC to address situation, such recommendation still relevant today – Pillay
New Commission of Inquiry established by @UN_HRC will begin to address #accountability issues on situation in #Gaza – Pillay
It is a terrible failure for humanity not to act to avert yet another devastating crisis in #Gaza – Pillay to UNGA
The humanitarian situation in #Gaza is at breaking point – UN #HumanRights Chief Pillay to UNGA: http://t.co/x662CNymTp
Severe effects of occupation in #Gaza &amp; #WestBank on Human Rights incl. right to self-determination must be addressed – Pillay
Hostilities, occupation, suffocating effects of blockade in place since 2007 = virtually unsustainable life in #Gaza – Pillay
Current conflict can't be viewed in isolation from repeated Israeli military ops in #Gaza or from protracted occupation –Pillay
Distinction between civilians/combatants, civilian objects/military objectives; proportionality; precautions in attack – Pillay (2/2)
#Israel/#Gaza: International law requires the application of 4 principles - UN Human Rights Chief Pillay to UNGA (1/2)
#Israel/#Gaza: I reiterate that actions by one party do not absolve the other party of its obligations under int’l law – Pillay to UNGA
#Israel/#Gaza: I have been equally clear that military assets should not be located in densely populated areas – Pillay to UNGA
I have consistently condemned the indiscriminate rocket fire from #Gaza into #Israel – Pillay to UNGA
Since 7 July, 3 civilians have been killed in #Israel and dozens more wounded – Pillay to UNGA
As of 5 Aug. 1,350 civilian Palestinians killed &amp; 1000s injured since launch of Israeli military operation on 7 July – Pillay
#Israel/#Gaza: I have repeatedly stated to all parties that civilians must not be targeted &amp; must be protected – Pillay to UNGA
#Israel/#Gaza: current tenuous #ceasefire offers critical chance for the parties to move from violence to peace – Navi Pillay
